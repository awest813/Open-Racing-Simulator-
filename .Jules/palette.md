## 2024-04-04 - Adding Proper Field Labels to Legacy Templates

**Learning:** Legacy `.ihtml` template structures often lack semantic `<label>` tags and matching `id` attributes on form elements, which significantly impairs screen reader support and keyboard navigation (e.g. clicking the label text to focus the input).

**Action:** When updating legacy template files, systematically verify that isolated descriptive text next to input fields is wrapped in a `<label for="field_id">` tag and ensure the corresponding `<input>`, `<select>`, or `<textarea>` has the matching `id="field_id"` attribute. This fixes micro-accessibility issues without changing visual styles.

## 2024-05-18 - Accessibility on Legacy .ihtml Forms
**Learning:** Legacy `.ihtml` template files in the `torcs_racing_board` project have many `input`/`select`/`textarea` elements without associated semantic labels, often presenting adjacent free text in `td` tags.
**Action:** Use standard `<label for="id">` tags around the free text, combined with explicit `id` attributes on the input fields, to improve structural and keyboard accessibility without requiring visual redesign or introducing new CSS frameworks.

## 2024-05-23 - Added label for better accessibility on race result submit form
**Learning:** Found an isolated `<input type="checkbox">` in `event_submit_result.ihtml` which had text right next to it but wasn't clickable as a label. Legacy systems often miss small interactions like clicking the label to check the checkbox.
**Action:** When working on old template files (.ihtml), ensure checkboxes have corresponding `id`s and `label` tags wrapped around adjacent text to improve target area and accessibility for screen readers.
