## 2024-05-24 - Default htmlentities() doesn't escape single quotes
**Vulnerability:** Reflected XSS in `torcs_racing_board` URL variables.
**Learning:** `htmlentities()` without the `ENT_QUOTES` flag leaves single-quoted attributes vulnerable to XSS.
**Prevention:** Always use `htmlentities($var, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')` or `htmlspecialchars($var, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')` when outputting user-controlled input, including server variables like `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` and `$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']`, into HTML attributes.

**Vulnerability:** Reflected XSS in `torcs_racing_board` URL variables.
**Learning:** `htmlentities()` without the `ENT_QUOTES` flag leaves single-quoted attributes vulnerable to XSS.
**Prevention:** Always use `htmlentities($var, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')` or `htmlspecialchars($var, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')` when outputting user-controlled input, including server variables like `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` and `$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']`, into HTML attributes.
## 2024-04-05 - Reflected XSS in PHP_SELF
**Vulnerability:** Legacy PHP assignments pass `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` directly to `.ihtml` template engine variables (e.g., `PS_LOGINPAGE`) without sanitization, leaving form `action` attributes unescaped and vulnerable to Reflected XSS attacks via URL path manipulation.
**Learning:** `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` includes raw URL-encoded characters up to the question mark (`?`). If placed directly into a form's action attribute without encoding single and double quotes, an attacker can break out of the HTML attribute and inject arbitrary scripts.
**Prevention:** Always wrap variables generated from the URL or headers (like `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`, `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']`, or `$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']`) using `htmlspecialchars($var, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')` before injecting them into HTML context.

## 2024-05-24 - Reflected XSS via `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`
**Vulnerability:** Found `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` directly passed to `.ihtml` template variables (like `PC_ACCOUNTPAGE` and `PS_LOGINPAGE`) in `account.php` without sanitization. An attacker could append malicious HTML to the URL which would be injected directly into form attributes.
**Learning:** `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` (and other server variables constructed from the URL) is not inherently safe and can be manipulated by an attacker to include XSS payloads, particularly in legacy PHP applications passing data directly into templates.
**Prevention:** Always wrap dynamically constructed URL segments or server variables in `htmlspecialchars($var, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')` before using them in templates or outputting them to the browser, ensuring single quotes are escaped properly for HTML attributes.
