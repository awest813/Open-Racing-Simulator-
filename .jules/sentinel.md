## 2024-05-24 - Default htmlentities() doesn't escape single quotes
**Vulnerability:** Reflected XSS in `torcs_racing_board` URL variables.
**Learning:** `htmlentities()` without the `ENT_QUOTES` flag leaves single-quoted attributes vulnerable to XSS.
**Prevention:** Always use `htmlentities($var, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')` or `htmlspecialchars($var, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')` when outputting user-controlled input, including server variables like `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` and `$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']`, into HTML attributes.

**Vulnerability:** Reflected XSS in `torcs_racing_board` URL variables.
**Learning:** `htmlentities()` without the `ENT_QUOTES` flag leaves single-quoted attributes vulnerable to XSS.
**Prevention:** Always use `htmlentities($var, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')` or `htmlspecialchars($var, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')` when outputting user-controlled input, including server variables like `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` and `$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']`, into HTML attributes.
## 2024-04-05 - Reflected XSS in PHP_SELF
**Vulnerability:** Legacy PHP assignments pass `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` directly to `.ihtml` template engine variables (e.g., `PS_LOGINPAGE`) without sanitization, leaving form `action` attributes unescaped and vulnerable to Reflected XSS attacks via URL path manipulation.
**Learning:** `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` includes raw URL-encoded characters up to the question mark (`?`). If placed directly into a form's action attribute without encoding single and double quotes, an attacker can break out of the HTML attribute and inject arbitrary scripts.
**Prevention:** Always wrap variables generated from the URL or headers (like `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']`, `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']`, or `$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']`) using `htmlspecialchars($var, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')` before injecting them into HTML context.
## 2024-05-24 - Reflected XSS in torcs_racing_board/account.php
**Vulnerability:** Reflected XSS via unsanitized `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` usage in `account.php`. It was directly assigned to template variables (e.g. `PC_ACCOUNTPAGE`) and passed to `countHit()`.
**Learning:** Legacy PHP code often assumes `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` is safe, but it can contain user-controlled input (like `/index.php/some_injected_path`) leading to XSS when outputting to HTML attributes (e.g., form actions).
**Prevention:** Always wrap `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` and similar server variables in `htmlspecialchars($var, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8')` before using them in HTML outputs or assignments.
