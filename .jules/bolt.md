**Learning:** Found multiple instances where `sqrt()` is calculated inside hot loops (e.g., iterating through corners to find the minimum distance) by using `dist()` methods on vector and straight classes.
**Action:** Introduced `lenSqr()` and `distSqr()` to avoid `sqrt` calculation until after finding the minimum squared distance. Always check if a squared distance comparison `distSqr < mindistSqr` can replace `dist < mindist` inside loops to avoid expensive operations.
